\section{Cats history}
Throughout history, cats have held a special place in human society, revered for their mysterious nature and valued for their practical contributions. Originating in ancient Egypt, cats were worshipped as symbols of divinity and protection. Their association with gods such as Bastet elevated their status to that of sacred beings, and they were often depicted in art and literature.

As civilizations flourished and trade routes expanded, cats traveled the world aboard ships, serving as invaluable companions to sailors by controlling vermin populations. During the Middle Ages in Europe, cats became associated with witchcraft and superstition, leading to mass persecution and the infamous witch hunts.

In the Renaissance period, cats experienced a revival in popularity as symbols of grace and elegance, appearing in paintings and literature as cherished pets of the aristocracy. Today, cats continue to enchant and fascinate people worldwide, maintaining their status as beloved companions and symbols of mystery and independence throughout history.
